# Print Pointer Value

### Objective

In this project, our main goal is to understand how to use pointers in C++.

### Problem

Create a pointer to reference a variable address `numVar` and then print the value of that variable using the pointer.

### Implementation
- Write your code in the main function.
  
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int numVar = 20;
    /* Your code here*/
    return 0;
}

```
